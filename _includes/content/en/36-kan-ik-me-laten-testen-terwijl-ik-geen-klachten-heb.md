At the moment, only people with complaints can request a corona test. From December 1st, 2020, the government will test people without complaints if contact research shows they were in close contact with a corona patient. The same applies to people who receive a notification in the CoronaMelder app because they have been in contact with someone with corona. These people can be tested 5 days after the last risky contact. Is the test negative? Then they skip quarantine.
