The results of the field test that looked at the technical operation of the CoronaMelder app showed that for encounters that lasted for longer than 15 minutes:
 
- for participants within 1.5 meters of each other: 
    - around 75% received a notification
    - around 25% did not receive a notification
- for participants more than 1.5 meters away from each other: 
    - around 75% did not receive a notification
    - around 25% received a notification (most of these were within 3 metres) 

Of all the test notifications sent during the field test, 60% were sent to people who had been more than 1.5 metres apart. This high number is due to the fact that a relatively large number of people in the test group (80%) were more than 1.5 metres apart. Of those in that group who received a notification, most were within 3 metres. The encounters always lasted for more than 15 minutes.
