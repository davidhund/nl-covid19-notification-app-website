If you receive a notification, it means that you have definitely been near somebody who has tested for positive for coronavirus, and that you were around them for more than 15 minutes.

The initial findings of the trials with the app show that there are more people who turn out to have been infected with coronavirus after receiving a notification from the app (10.5%) than there are close contacts who test positive for coronavirus after being contacted as part of source and contact tracing (5.8%).
