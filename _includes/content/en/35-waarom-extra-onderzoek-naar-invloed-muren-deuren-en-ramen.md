The practical tests, done before the launch of CoronaMelder, have already tested the influence of walls, doors, and windows on the Bluetooth signal between two phones using the app.

CoronaMelder uses software from Google and Apple to measure Bluetooth signals. Google and Apple now made a new version of that software. Before CoronaMelder included it in the app, we perform a new, extensive test. We pay extra attention to the influence of walls, doors, and windows. We also test with walls made of different materials so that we get to know the differences.

We expect to conduct this survey in November and/or December 2020. We hope to work together with parties that make the German corona app.
