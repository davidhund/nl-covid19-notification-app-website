CoronaMelder only sends a notification after someone has tested positive. After that, the app will no longer register that this notification has been made and will not send repeated notifications.

If you use personal protective equipment and you work with corona patients, it is possible to temporarily disable CoronaMelder to prevent false reports. You temporarily turn off the app by turning off Bluetooth in your settings. If you do not use personal protective equipment, we recommend to use CoronaMelder and have it switched on.
