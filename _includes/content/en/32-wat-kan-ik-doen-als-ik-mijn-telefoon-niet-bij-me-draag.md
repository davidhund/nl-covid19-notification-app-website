To make CoronaMelder function as reliably as possible, it is essential to always carry your phone with CoronaMelder on it. However, you may not have your phone with you all the time, for example, because you will exercise or because you have to store your phone in a locker during work. At those times, you can choose to temporarily turn off Bluetooth. This way, you prevent the app from unintentionally sharing codes with other phones and sending notifications while you are not in contact with the other. It is essential to turn the Bluetooth back on afterward.
